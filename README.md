# Awesomes LLM for Traffic Prediction Papers

This is a list of papers about training data quality management for ML models.

## Introduction

Traffic prediction is a crucial aspect of intelligent transportation systems, aiming to utilize historical data to forecast future traffic characteristics at specific locations. While many current traffic prediction models focus on creating complex neural network architectures, their accuracy has not significantly improved. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series analysis. Unlike traditional models, LLMs primarily enhance their capabilities through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining, while preserving their core structures.

Noticing this intriguing research problem, we collect the recent influential papers about utilizing LLM for traffic prediction as belows.
